Dominating set
==============

Sequential and parallel code to compute the size of the smallest dominating set of a given graph,  using C++ and openmp.

Context

From Wikipedia: 

_In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D of V such that 
every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one member of D. The domination number γ(G) is the number of 
vertices in a smallest dominating set for G._

_The dominating set problem concerns testing whether γ(G) ≤ K for a given graph G and input K; it is a classical 
NP-complete decision problem in computational complexity theory (Garey & Johnson 1979). 
Therefore it is believed that there is no efficient algorithm that finds a smallest dominating set for a given graph."_
